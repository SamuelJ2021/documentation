Membership Products` and click :guilabel:`New`.

Publish members directory
=========================

To publish a list of active members on the website, the *Online Members Directory* application must
first be :ref:`installed <general/install>`. After installing the module, add the `/members` page to
the website's menu by :doc:`editing the website menu <../websites/website/pages/menus>`.

Publish individual members
--------------------------

Return to :menuselection:`CRM app --> Sales --> Customers`, and click the Kanban card for a member.
Click the :guilabel:`Go to Website` smart button at the top of the page to open the member's
webpage.

After making any necessary changes to the page, click :guilabel:`Save`. At the top of the page,
slide the :guilabel:`Unpublished` toggle to the active, :guilabel:`Published` position.

Repeat these steps for all members.
